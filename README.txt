About
-----
Reinforcement learning in python.

This code is intended mainly as proof of concept of the algorithms presented in 
[1]. The implementations are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested or 
numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic 
purposes.

Features
--------
Agents:
    Model-based (value and policy iteration)
    Model-free (Monte Carlo, Sarsa, Q-learning and variations)
    Model-building (Dyna-Q)

Examples
--------
