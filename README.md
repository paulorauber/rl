# Reinforcement learning in python

This code is intended mainly as proof of concept of the algorithms presented in [1]. The implementations are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested or numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic purposes.

## Agents

* Model-based (value and policy iteration)
* Model-free (Monte Carlo, Sarsa, Q-learning and variations)
* Model-building (Dyna-Q)
